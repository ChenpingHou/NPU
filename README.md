# # Code of NPU(**Confidence-based PU Learning with Instance-Dependent Label Noise**)

## Overview
This is the code for the paper "Confidence-based PU Learning with Instance-Dependent Label Noise", which proposes a novel method Noisy PU(NPU) for dealing PU learning under instance-dependent label noise problem. 

## Main Files
There are two main files to implement NPU method in the paper. 
* NPU_train.m: the main algorithm code.

* demo.m: script that you can directly run on synthetic dataset sample.mat.
